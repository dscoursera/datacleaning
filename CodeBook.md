There are 180 rows (records) and 68 columns (variables). This data set is a tidy data 
derived from Human Activity Recognition on Smartphones data: 
[http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones]
(http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones). 

The original data set had 10,299 records and 563 columns. The preparation of reduced data 
set is explained in **README.md** .

There are 66 numeric variables (features) representing measurements for six activities on 
30 human subjects. The features were normalized and bounded within [-1,1] in the original 
data set so they are unit-less numbers.

The variable activity is a factor and the variable subjecteid is numeric (1 to 30).

**The six activities are:**

1 WALKING

2 WALKING\_UPSTAIRS

3 WALKING\_DOWNSTAIRS

4 SITTING

5 STANDING

6 LAYING

**The 66 features are:**

The prefix 't' denotes time and the prefix 'f' denotes frequency. The suffix X, Y, or Z 
denotes 3-axial signals in the X, Y and Z directions.

The Acc indicates that the feature came from the accelerometer. Gyro indicates that the 
feature came from from the gyroscope.

BodyAcc means it is a body acceleration signal and GravityAcc means it is a gravity 
acceleration signal.

BodyAccJerk and BodyGyroJerk were derived from body linear acceleration and angular velocity.

The mean and std in the variable names indicate that only the mean and the standard 
deviation values of these variables were retained in tidy data set to get 66 variables.
